			<h4>The Blues Brothers</h4>
			<p>
				This musical/comedy film has the best Soundtrack that i can remember, as well as a lot of funny gags which make you laugh without stop.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides that, it also contains a lot of action and one of the biggest car crashing scenes ever filmed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another big attractive and a "must see" reason for this film is the appearance of so many Soul/Blues stars, as James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, and so on. They take part in the trama in a really well written script.
